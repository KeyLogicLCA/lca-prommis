    "As shown in the system boundary below, the scope of this work starts with the leaching of size-reduced REE-rich feedstock (REE: Rare Earth Elements) and ends with the recovery of mixed REO solids. The process consists of six main stages: 1) Mixing and Leaching, 2) Rougher Solvent Extraction, 3) Cleaner Solvent Extraction, 4) Precipitation, 5) Solid-Liquid (S/L) separation, and 6) Roasting. </br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<u> Functional Unit:</u> The function unit is 1 kg of recovered REO solids\n",

    "<u> Allocation:</u> The evaluated flowsheet produces a single product with no intermediate co-products or by-product. As a result, there is no need for allocation in this modeling exercise.\n",

    "<u> Life cycle inventory Estimation:</u> The material and energy inputs shown in the system boundary figure below have been shortlisted and estimated based on the UKy flowsheet output, [technical reports on the production on the production of REE from coal and coal by-products](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1569277), and other relevant literature.\n",

The scope of this work starts with the leaching of size-reduced REE-rich feedstock (REE: Rare Earth Elements) and ends with the recovery of mixed REO solids. The process consists of six main stages: 1) Mixing and Leaching, 2) Rougher Solvent Extraction, 3) Cleaner Solvent Extraction, 4) Precipitation, 5) Solid-Liquid (S/L) separation, and 6) Roasting. This process does not account for upstream processes leading to the production of REE-rich feedstock nor does it account for Downstream processes leading to the separation of REE contained in the REO. The main product is a rare earth oxide solid with no other by-products or co-products. The functional unit is 1 kg of recovered REO solids. The material and energy inputs shown in the system boundary figure below have been shortlisted and estimated based on the UKy flowsheet output, as well as other relevant literature.\""
