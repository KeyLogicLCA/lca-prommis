    "<u> Goal and Scope:</u> In this Jupyter Notebook, we use life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impact of Rare Earth Oxide Recovery from coal mining refuse.</br>\n",
    "As shown in the system boundary below, the scope of this work starts with the leaching of size-reduced REE-rich feedstock (REE: Rare Earth Elements) and ends with the recovery of mixed REO solids. The process consists of six main stages: 1) Mixing and Leaching, 2) Rougher Solvent Extraction, 3) Cleaner Solvent Extraction, 4) Precipitation, 5) Solid-Liquid (S/L) separation, and 6) Roasting. </br>\n",
    "It's crucial to note here that the current script does not account for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upstream processes leading to the production of REE-rich feedstock \n",

    "\n",
    "* Downstream processes leading to the separation of REE contained in the REO    \n",

    "<u> Main Product:</u> The main product of the flowsheet modeled in this Jupyter Notebook is Rare Earth Oxide (REO) solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Co-products or by-products:</u> None\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Functional Unit:</u> The function unit is 1 kg of recovered REO solids\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Allocation:</u> The evaluated flowsheet produces a single product with no intermediate co-products or by-product. As a result, there is no need for allocation in this modeling exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Life cycle inventory Estimation:</u> The material and energy inputs shown in the system boundary figure below have been shortlisted and estimated based on the UKy flowsheet output, [technical reports on the production on the production of REE from coal and coal by-products](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1569277), and other relevant literature.\n",

The process consists of six main stages: 1) Mixing and Leaching, 2) Rougher Solvent Extraction, 3) Cleaner Solvent Extraction, 4) Precipitation, 5) Solid-Liquid (S/L) separation, and 6) Roasting. This process does not account for upstream processes leading to the production of REE-rich feedstock nor does it account for Downstream processes leading to the separation of REE contained in the REO. The main product is a rare earth oxide solid with no other by-products or co-products. The functional unit is 1 kg of recovered REO solids. The material and energy inputs shown in the system boundary figure below have been shortlisted and estimated based on the UKy flowsheet output, as well as other relevant literature.\n"
